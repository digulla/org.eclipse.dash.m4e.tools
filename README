This project collects a couple of tools to convert Eclipse downloads
and installations into Maven 2 repositories.

NOTE: Right now, all tools are hardwired to write the results to
"../tmp/". So if you start them with "org.eclipse.dash.m4e.tools/src/"
being the current folder, the path will be "org.eclipse.dash.m4e.tools/tmp/"

If you start the scripts from the folder which contains this README,
the tmp folder will be created outside the project.

A typical session looks like this:

> ./m4e-import.py ~/eclipse-3.6
> ./m4e-import.py ~/Downloads/eclipse-platform-SDK-3.6.2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
> ./m4e-merge.py ../tmp/*_home/m2repo ../tmp/m2repo
> ./m4e-attach-sources.py ../tmp/m2repo/

This imports all plug-ins from an existing Eclipse 3.6 install, adds the source
plug-ins from the SDK download, and merges the two new Maven 2 repositories.

The last step moves the source JARs in the right place.
