TODO
====

- The merge tool reports a lot of JARs that are signed twice during the
  build. Find a way to get rid of these messages.
- Add a tool to convert the M2 repo in tmp/ into something suitable for
  Nexus

DONE
====

* Instead of overwriting a dependency, move it into a profile so users
  can decide which one to use
* Patches to delete dependencies
* Analysis tool
* Create a POM with a dependencyManagement element that contains all the
  versions of all POMs in this repo, suitable for using it to
  import dependencies (see http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies)
